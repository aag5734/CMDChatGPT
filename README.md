# CMDChatGPT
A command line application that connects to ChatGPT for those who are too lazy to open their browser

## Setup
To begin, you will have to download the [openAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication?lang=python) and [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) libraries. Additionally, you'll also need your own openai api key. 

Here's an example bash alias you can use to quickly run the program.

```
alias chatgpt="/bin/python /home/cicada/Documents/OSSProjects/PDFMerge/cmdgpt.py"
```
